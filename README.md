# City_Management_System
Using Graph Algorithm and Various Data Structures of Generic Library inspired by STL in C++ and  CRUD Operations 


I have created a small project using the library of Data Structures, with the help of which all the Data Structures are used to know how to use them.



i proposed this system with the help of File Handling for storing data and routes of cities and various Data Structure for traversing various cities and add their adjacent vertex with the help of Graph algorithms. Comparator plays major role in our project.

With this system we can easily do some operations like add, edit, update, delete information of cities (CRUD Operations) on them . Apart from that user can find the shortest path between the two cities.

The main technology used in this project is purely C language. Data saves in a file using file handling. Data structures maintain a sequential format and play a key role behind the success of this project.

The information of all the cities(name) is resulted in a sorted manner and we can also add adjacent vertex and edges between more than two cities.
In addition, it also shows the distance between the source and the target destination
